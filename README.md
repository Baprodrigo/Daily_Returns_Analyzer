### Key Concepts Learned

| Concept                           | Why it matters in finance                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **APIs & data ingestion**         | Every quant pipeline starts with clean, automated data collection.     |
| **Adjusted close prices**         | Reflect total return (splits/dividends). Always use them for accuracy. |
| **Returns & compounding**         | Normalize performance across assets; measure growth properly.          |
| **Rolling volatility**            | Risk is time-varying â€” rolling windows show volatility clusters.       |
| **Annualization (âˆš252)**          | Compare daily metrics on a consistent yearly scale.                    |
| **Visualization**                 | Good plots tell better stories than raw tables.                        |
| **Reproducible folder structure** | Separating `/data` and `/figures` = professional workflow.             |
